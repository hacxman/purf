Purf is a single window broser using WebKit, QT4 and Python with plans
to move to PyQT5 once python QWebKit is available for QT5.

Features - no tabs, no adblock(yet), Back/Forward, hideous URL bar,
web inspector, no history, no cache, no nothing.

Planned: no tabs, extensions (adblock), zooming, history with string matching
a la firefox, search engine integration into URL bar via prefix
(e.g. - g pizza - search pizza on google), no session tracking included.

Session tracking (i.e. opened windows, restore last closed window, etc)
will be maintained in external program probably mounted via FUSE with 9P
option so that user can restore opened tabs on other computer.

Usage:
./purf [URL]
